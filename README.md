Violent offending in young people is a pressing and damaging issue. There are numerous studies which have been conducted to explore underlying causal mechanisms for youth violence. However, irrespective of the contribution of the studies performed to date, youth violence persists. It is therefore crucial that changes in approaches towards dealing with such are considered. Harnessing routinely collected data to identify potential at-risk individuals removes the need for additional targeted funding and resource and means that more wide-spread and rapid identification of at-risk individuals can take place. Routinely collected police data is an unexplored source of potential risk markers for identifying those at greater risk of committing a first violent offence during adolescence. The code contained here is built to work with a specific routinely collected police dataset (force unnamed for confidentiality). The code supports the development, cleaning and modelling of the police data, to aid in identifying specific risk markers. The intention is that these risk markers will be used in the future to identify at an early stage, those at an elevated risk of committing a first violent offence so that intervention and support can be given to prevent this outcome from occurring. The code will also support future researchers if they undertake similar projects and investigations to the one completed by this author.
